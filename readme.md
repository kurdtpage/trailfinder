# Trail Finder

Website that aims to help people find hiking trails in New Zealand.

Will have searchable fields that hopefully don't suck. Search by location rather than search by input fields. "Find tracks close to me" is a better option.

_Features include:_
- Details about the track
    - Start/end GPS position
    - I have not added length or time taken, because sometimes tracks can get quite complicated and join onto other tracks
- Sorts of things that you'll see, e.g plants/animals
- Track gradient or difficulty, elevation
- Zoomable topo map showing track
    - Topo map is good because it shows elevations/gradients
- Google map for how to get to the start of the map
    - Possibility for "send to my phone" for directions to start
- Weather info
- Downloadable links
    - KML file
    - Printout to take with you
